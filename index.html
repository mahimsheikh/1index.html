    <p>The name of our country is the People's Republic of Bangladesh. It is one of the most beautiful countries in the
        world. Our country was a part of Pakistan before 1971. Then we freed our country and achieved victory after nine
        month's liberation war. 3 million people sacrificed their lives in the liberation war in 1971. Our independence
        day is 26th March and Victory day is 16th December. The national language of our country is Bangla. It is also a
        matter of great pride for us that we are the only nation who sacrificed their lives for the sake of their mother
        tongue in 21st February of 1952. In order to show respect to them, UNESCO has declared 21st February as
        International Mother Language Day. The name of the capital of Bangladesh is Dhaka. It is the busiest and
        populated city of our country. The total population is 16 crore. The total area of our country is 1,47,570
        square km. Our country is a river-oriented country.</p>
